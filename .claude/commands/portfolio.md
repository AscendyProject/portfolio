description: Generate a grounded portfolio from a GitHub repo or a blog/article URL (runs python -m portfolio).
argument-hint: "[github <repo-url> <author>] | [web <article-url> <author>] [--out <file>]"
---

The user wants to generate a **grounded** portfolio — every claim traced to real
evidence — by running this repo's CLI (`python -m portfolio`). You are the
interactive front door; the CLI does the real work (extract → narrate → ground →
render). Do NOT write portfolio claims yourself and do NOT edit any code.

Arguments (may be empty): `$ARGUMENTS`

## Steps

1. **Gather the inputs** from `$ARGUMENTS`; ask the user for anything missing:
   - **source type** — one of `github`, `web`, `github-author`, or `portfolio`. If it's unclear,
     ask the user to choose:
     - `github` → a GitHub repository, evidence is the author's merged PRs (via `gh`).
     - `web` → a blog/article URL, evidence is the fetched article.
     - `github-author` → author-wide: merged PRs across **all** repos the `gh` token
       can see. Only `--author` is required; `--source` is not used.
       > **Note:** output may include private repo names. Redact before sharing.
     - `portfolio` → re-render a previously saved grounded portfolio JSON file (no `gh`
       extraction, no LLM narration). `--source` must be the path to the saved `.json`
       file; `--author` is accepted but ignored (the file's subject wins).
   - **source URL** — `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` for github, or the
     article URL for web. Not required for `github-author`. Path to `.json` for `portfolio`.
   - **author** — the GitHub handle whose merged PRs are the evidence (github /
     github-author), or the subject the portfolio is for (web). Not used for `portfolio`.
   - optionally **--out <file>** if the user wants the Markdown written to a file
     instead of shown inline.
   - optionally **--emit-portfolio <file>** to save the grounded Portfolio as a JSON
     file that can later be reused with `--source-type portfolio`.

2. **Run the CLI** with exactly those values (pass each as a separate argument —
   never assemble a shell string from the user's input):

   ```
   python -m portfolio --source-type <type> --source <url> --author <author>
   ```

   Add `--out <file>` only if the user asked to save to a file.
   Add `--emit-portfolio <file>` only if the user asked to save the Portfolio JSON.
   Use `python` (not `python3`) on this host.

3. **On a non-zero exit**, show the CLI's stderr message and help the user fix the
   input — e.g. an invalid/unsupported `--source` URL, or an unknown
   `--source-type` (the CLI validates and reports these). Do NOT retry with a
   guessed URL, author, or source type.

4. **On success**, show the user:
   - the rendered Markdown portfolio (or, with `--out`, confirm the file path), and
   - the one-line **grounding summary** the CLI prints on stderr
     (`grounded: N  rejected: N  needs-confirmation: N`) so they can see how many
     drafted claims were dropped for lacking real evidence.

   The output now leads with a grounded headline blockquote, a stats line (merged-PR
   count · distinct repos · language stack), an optional `## Highlights` section
   (bullets citing grounded refs), and per-language `## <Group>` sections for the
   claims — `## Other` always appears last.

## Hard rules

- Use ONLY the source URL and author the user supplies. Never fabricate a repo,
  URL, PR, or author to make the command produce output.
- This command's only job is to invoke `python -m portfolio`. Never bypass it,
  never hand-write claims, and never modify `portfolio/` code to "make it work".
- If the CLI reports a source type is unsupported, relay that — don't try to
  implement it here.
